# Restaurant-Recommendation-System
Restaurant Recommendation System is a system used to recommend restaurant based on user's requirement like his/her location and Cuisine of his/her choice. It is filtering/Content based recommendation system. We have used the zomato data of banglore restaurants. This System requires Userâ€™s location within the Banglore city and the cuisine that user want to have and based on that recommend best restaurant to the user on the basis of the sentiment extracted from the previous reviews of the other users. I have used MmongoDB database that comes under NoSQL Databases to store the data of my restaurant to fetch  the restauraant faster as per the user requirement.
